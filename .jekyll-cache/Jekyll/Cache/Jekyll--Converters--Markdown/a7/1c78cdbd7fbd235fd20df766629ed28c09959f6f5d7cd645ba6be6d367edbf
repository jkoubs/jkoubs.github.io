I"æ<p>Hello, I‚Äôm Jason Koubi, a Robotics Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering. My journey into robotics software development began with my first project, ‚ÄúCali,‚Äù an autonomous mobile manipulator designed to carry out Fetch-and-Carry missions. Developing Cali from scratch not only deepened my understanding of robotics but also fueled my passion for creating intelligent systems that interact effortlessly with their surroundings.</p>

<p>As a ROS expert, I‚Äôm now looking to join a forward-thinking team dedicated to pioneering robotics software development. I‚Äôm seeking a role as a Robotics Software Engineer or ROS Developer, where I can contribute my skills and continue advancing in this thrilling field. If you‚Äôre hiring, I‚Äôd love to connect!</p>

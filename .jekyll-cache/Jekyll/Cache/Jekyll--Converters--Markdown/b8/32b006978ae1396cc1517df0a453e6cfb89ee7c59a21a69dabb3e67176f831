I"<p>Hello, I’m Jason Koubi, a Robotics Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about/profile_pic.jpg" alt="About Me" width="70%" /></p>

<p>My journey into robotics software development began with my first project, “Cali,” an autonomous mobile manipulator designed to carry out Fetch-and-Carry missions. Developing Cali from scratch not only deepened my understanding of robotics but also fueled my passion for creating intelligent systems that interact effortlessly with their surroundings.</p>

<p>As a ROS expert, I’m now looking to join a forward-thinking team dedicated to pioneering robotics software development. I’m seeking a role as a Robotics Software Engineer or ROS Developer, where I can contribute my skills and continue advancing in this thrilling field. If you’re hiring, I’d love to connect!</p>

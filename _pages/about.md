Hello, I’m Jason Koubi, a Robotics Software Engineer with a unique journey that bridges Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Robotics Software Development.

<img src="/images/about/profile_pic.jpg" alt="About Me" width="50%">

My robotics journey began during my Master's in Mechanical Engineering after earning a Bachelor’s in Physics. I began with a focus on the mechanical aspects of robotics, but I quickly realized my true passion lies in empowering robots to think, learn, and interact intelligently with their environment.

This realization led me to dive deep into robotics software, starting with learning ROS (Robot Operating System). To solidify my skills, I enrolled in the first batch of the Robotics Developer Master Class by The Construct. This intensive program provided me with a comprehensive understanding of ROS and modern robotics software development, truly kick-starting my career.

Since then, I’ve worked on exciting projects like [Cali](https://jkoubs.github.io/project/2022-12-cali) , an autonomous mobile manipulator designed to perform a Fetch-and-Carry mission in an indoor environment. Building Cali was a transformative experience, blending mechanical and software expertise to create an intelligent robotic system.

Now, as a ROS expert, I’m eager to join a forward-thinking team where I can apply my skills, tackle complex challenges, and contribute to groundbreaking robotics projects. If you’re hiring, I’d love to connect!
Let’s build the future of robotics together.

### **Robotics Software Engineer Intern** | Karelics  
*January 2023 – April 2023*  

- Created Docker container in ROS 2 Galactic for code development
- Built ROS 2 Navigation node implementing Smac Hybrid Planner and created a goal validity checker node that checks for
goal pose validity and recalculates a new valid goal pose when required
- Implemented unit tests for goal validity checker node
- Established behavior tree node that implements service node into behavior tree to integrate service into ROS 2 Navigation
- Tested proposed solution on the company's robot showing promising results
- Documented the project in a [blog post](https://karelics.fi/developing-a-goal-validity-checker-node-for-navigation-goals/) and shared the codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/Karelics/goal_validity_checker) for future reference

## Overview

***Cali*** is an open-source robotic platform designed for research and education in mobile manipulation. It leverages off-the-shelf components and integrates open-source software to facilitate high-level task development for mobile manipulators.

*Cali* is composed of a customed 4-wheeled skid steer drive mobile platform and a commercial manipulator system: ***Scorbot-ER III***:


### Goal

Develop a modular, extensible system that simplifies mobile manipulator research and enables autonomous **Fetch-and-Carry missions**.


### Key Features

- Modular integration of navigation, manipulation, and perception pipelines.
- ROS Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04-based platform.
- Hardware includes a skid-steer drive base and Sorbot-ER III robotic arm.
- Real-time operation with Nvidia Jetson TX2.



## Technical Approach

### Hardware

- **Base:** Custom four-wheeled skid-steer base.
- **Manipulator:** ***Sorbot-ER III*** robotic arm with 5 DOF + gripper.
- **Sensors:** LiDAR, depth camera, IMU, encoders.
- **Power:** 12V 50Ah lithium battery.

### Software

- **Framework:** ROS Melodic.
- **Simulator:** Gazebo.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Moveit

### Subsystems

- Mapping, navigation, manipulation, and perception pipelines.
- Manipulation/Perception pipeline.

### Manipulation/Perception Pipeline

## Results

### Simulated Environment

As we have seen *Cali* has successfully performed the high-level task:

- Mapping
- Autonomous Navigation
- Manipulation
- Perception
- Manipulation/Perception pipeline

**As a result it was able to successfully perform the Fetch-and-carry mission in an indoor environment.**

### Real Robot


![real_robot_v2](/images/projects/2022-12-cali/real_robot_v2.png)

- Successfully performed autonomous navigation and perception pipelines for the real robot.
- Due to time constraints, the manipulation pipeline was not integrated as communication with the arm manipulator could not be established due to some time constraints with my university.
- This limitation will be addressed in the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section, immediately following this one.


Here is a GIF demonstrating the real robot's autonomous navigation:

Now let's observe the perception results on the real robot:

## Next Steps

There is still work yet to be done to realize the real-world application of the Fetch-and-Carry task, specifically in controlling the robot arm using the ***FollowJointTrajectory*** and ***GripperCommand*** action interfaces. Future efforts will investigate hardware interfaces or alternatives to rosserial for communication. Once communication with these action interfaces is established, *Cali* will be able to achieve its mission in the real world.

Here are some suggestions for potential next steps:

- Establish communication with manipulation interfaces to enable real-world task execution.
- Develop a **hardware interface** to facilitate communication with the manipulator.
- Implement **failure recovery procedures** to address unexpected issues, such as unsuccessful task completion (e.g., grasping failures).

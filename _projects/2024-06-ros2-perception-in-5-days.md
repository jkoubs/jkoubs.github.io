## Overview

***ROS 2 Perception in 5 Days*** is an educational course I developed during my time working with **The Construct Robotics Institute**. This course embarks on an exciting journey into the realm of **perception** in robotics using ROS 2. Through a series of structured units and hands-on projects, participants explore various aspects of sensor data processing and perception techniques.

### Goal

This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of **perception techniques in robotics using ROS 2**. By the end of this course, you'll be equipped with the skills to process sensor data, perform image and point cloud processing, implement human-robot interaction techniques, and apply AI-based perception methods in robotics.

### Key Features

- Step-by-step guidance for creating perception pipelines using ROS 2.
- Projects involving object detection, surface recognition, and pose estimation.
- Application of open-source tools like OpenCV and PCL.
- Modular lessons designed for learners of varying experience levels.

## Overview

***Mastering Reinforcement Learning for Robotics*** is a course I developed during my time working with **The Construct Robotics Institute**. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) concepts and their application to robotics. Through a highly practical approach, participants gain the skills to design, implement, and evaluate RL algorithms for robotic systems.


### Goal

This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) concepts and how to apply them to robotics. By the end of this journey, you'll have the skills to:

- Design RL algorithms.
- Implement and test RL methods in simulated robotic environments.
- Evaluate RL systems for complex robotic tasks.

### Key Features

- Minimal theory with a focus on hands-on learning.
- Structured units that progress from fundamental to advanced RL techniques.
- Step-by-step guidance for building RL pipelines.

## Technical Approach

### Software

- **Framework:** ROS 2 Humble.
- **Simulation Tools:** Gazebo, PyGame.
- **Libraries:** PyTorch.

## What You Will Learn

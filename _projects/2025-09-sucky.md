## Overview

![sucky](/images/projects/2025-09-sucky/sucky_real.png)

***Sucky*** is an autonomous cleaning robot designed to navigate and operate in dust-heavy industrial environments.The project showcases the transition from simulation to a fully functioning real-world robot, leveraging ROS 2 for mapping, navigation, and full coverage path planning.


### Goals

- Deploy SLAM, navigation and coverage planning from simulation to the real robot.
- Handle **real-world complexities** such as dust interference, dynamic obstacles, and uneven flooring.
- Tune and validate **Full Coverage Path Planning** for reliable, systematic cleaning.
- Develop a robust platform for **future industrial-scale deployments**.


## Technical Approach

### Hardware

- **Drive Base:** Two powered drive wheels combined with two free-spinning mecanum caster wheels for stability. The robot uses a differential drive configuration to control movement, making it simple yet effective for navigating industrial environments like a sawmill.
- **LiDAR:** Sick TIM781 for accurate and reliable obstacle detection.
- **Depth Camera:** Intel RealSense D455 equivalent for 3D perception and SLAM.
- **Computer:** Jetson Orin Nano.
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Integration for vacuum and cleaning peripherals.

### Software

- **Frameworks:** ROS 2 Humble, Foxglove.
- **Simulator:** Gazebo.
- **Nav2 Stack:** Provides navigation, planning, and autonomous movement.
- **RTAB-Map:** For 3D mapping and localization.

## Key Contributions

- **3D Mapping:** Implemented RTAB-Map for mapping and localization in the sawmill’s challenging layout.
- **Behavior Trees (BTs):** A custom behavior tree was developed to integrate SpiralSTC planning, based on the [Full Coverage Path Planner](https://github.com/nobleo/full_coverage_path_planner) repo from [nobleo](https://github.com/nobleo/full_coverage_path_planner).
- **Coverage Planning:** Implemented the [Full Coverage Path Planning (FCPP)](https://github.com/nobleo/full_coverage_path_planner) planner plugin in ROS 2 for systematic cleaning. Added a an interpolation_resolution parameter for better fine-tuning.
- **Navigation:** Tuned Nav2 parameters for robust real-world navigation, with a major focus on the controller_server and MPPI (Model Predictive Path Integral) controller for robust path following and dynamic obstacle handling.
- **LiDAR and Camera Filtering:** Designed and implemented filtering strategies to handle **airborne dust**, a major challenge in the sawmill environment.


## Results

### 3D SLAM with RTAB-Map

This 3D map allows us to extract a 2D slice that will serve as the base for navigation:

## Ideas for Improvement

Looking ahead, there are **three primary areas for improvement** that will significantly enhance the system’s performance, robustness, and usability:

- **Enhanced dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy**
- **Integrating Opennav Coverage into the real robot for finer control of coverage areas**
- **Adding higher-level error handling and notification logic**

Some other future enhancements worth exploring with lower priority include:

- **Hose detection pipeline**
- **Automated dumping process**
- **Automated charging**
- **Cleaning progress & robot status dashboard**
